he class is ten weeks long.  Each week will have a quiz and one or two required programming assignments.  The programming assignments will show up in the external grade book as a 0.0 or 1.0.  There is no partial credit on programming assignments - if you complete the assignment you get 100% credit.   These 1.0 grades will be scaled up at the end of to course to be 10 points per programming assignment.  There will also be a final exam worth 20 points.

This means that the total points for the course not including extra credit will be 260 points (10 quizzes, 14 programming assignments and one exam).   The cutoff for the Statement of Accomplishment will be 75% (195 points) and the cutoff for a certificate with distinction will be 90% (233 points).

At various points in the course there will be opportunities for extra credit.  All extra credit points will be added to a student's score and help the student qualify for the statements of accomplishment.   There is no requirement to complete the extra credit assignments - but completing the assignments will make it easier to achieve the minimum scores for the SOAs and certificates.

The assignment due dates will be hard deadlines.  We will not enable late days.   At the end of the course students will be given a short time period near the end of class to repeat a limited amount of work that was missed earlier in the class.  So if you miss one quiz or assignment - keep going.
